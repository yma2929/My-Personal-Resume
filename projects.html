        <h2>Introduction to Database Project</h2>
        <p> <strong>Project Title:</strong>Resort Database Managment System <br>
            <strong>Project Description:</strong>This project involved designing and implementing a database management system for a resort.
            The system was created to store and manage information about guests, rooms, reservations, and other relevant data. 
            The database was designed and implemented using SQL. The project included creating tables, defining relationships, 
            and writing queries to retrieve and update data. The goal of the project was to develop an enhanced version of the database managment
            system to provide a wider net of functionalities. </p>

        <p> <strong>Project Title:</strong>TechLinker System <br>
            <strong>Project Description:</strong>TechLinker is an innovative app that was designed to bridge the gap between technical specialists, companies, and universities.
            The goal of the project was to create a platform that fosters innovation, creativity, and collaboration within the tech community. 
            It enables users to design unique profiles that highlight their qualifications, experiences, and abilities. TechLinker facilitates access to a range of educational 
            resources and career and internship possibilities by providing a platform for connecting with tech companies.

        <h2>Digital Logic Design Project</h2>
        <p> <strong>Project Title:</strong>ALU - Arthimetic Logic Unit <br> 
            <strong>Project Description:</strong>
            This project involves designing and simulating a basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), a critical component of a CPU responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations. 
            The ALU in this project is designed to execute two primary operations: addition and subtraction.
            It uses two 4-bit inputs (A and B) and a mode selector (M0) to produce a 4-bit output (F), which is displayed on a 7-segment LED via a BCD-to-7-segment decoder.
            The project is designed to provide a hands-on learning experience with digital logic circuits, using basic components such as gates and switches to perform fundamental arithmetic operations.
